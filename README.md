ABOUT THIS PROJECT-:

1. This is a simple static music player created using pure HTML and CSS as part of my MERN stack course in Coding Ninjas.

2. Project has 2 pages, one for home and another for single-playlist which can be accessed by clicking on any image/link of Popular Artist Section and also through the      option provided in nav bar. 

3. Although the website is mostly responsive, still it has some minor issues for smaller screens and need improvements. It will be covered in updated versions.
